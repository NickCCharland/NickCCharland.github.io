				<h2>About This Project</h2>
				<p>
					This project was completed in SMAD 317: User Interaction Design. The purpose for creating this project was to explore the fundamentals of User Interaction Design through utilizing the design thinking process. This included empathizing, defining, idealizing, protoyping, and testing an idea for an application that solved a specific issue.<br><br>
					This project came out of an idea for
					students, professionals, and anyone else who does their work outside of an office to
					find an easy place to study or do their work. Originally, we geared this project towards
					college students, but it has become a tool for a much greater audience.<br><br></p>
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>After our class was divided into teams of two, we had to figure out the roles that each team member would fulfill over the course of this project. While William and I wanted to collaborate on as many aspects of this project as we could, we each decided to choose one area for us to work on individually. I decided that along with user research, prototyping, and the creation of mockups, I also wanted to conduct extensive interviews of our potential users to gain a better understanding of how we could find solutions to the identified problem statement.</p><br>

						<p>Our first task as a team was to identify a common problem that individuals faced regularly. This could have been for any groups of users, however, we chose to focus on students and freelance workers in the Harrisonburg community. We then conducted extensive user research to identify a common problem that this group of users faced in regard to everyday tasks.
					</p> <br>
					<p>We began
						with brainstorming ideas while researching other apps who served a similar purpose.
						We found the other apps that served a similar function either had low functionality
					or aimed to serve a hyperspecific audience, so we set out to conquer both of these hills.</p><br><br>

					<h2>User Research</h2>
					<p>During the user research phase of this project, I decided that I would interview six individuals, students and freelancers, and asked them about their studying habits both on and off of campus—where they liked to study, why they preferred to study at one location over another, who they study with, how long they studied for on a typical day, frustrations they had about studying on campus or in their off-campus housing complexes, and many more questions. I was able to conduct four of these interviews in person and two of them through a series of email exchanges. <br><br>

						After the interviews were completed and their responses were collected, we had to figure out a way to analyze and sort our findings. We decided to create an affinity diagram to help analyze and discover commonalities amongst our users based on the answers they provided.
					</p> <br><br>

					<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
					<p>After this phase of the project was completed, we had enough information and data to properly form a design problem statement. 

						<strong>How might we improve the experience of students and freelancers trying to find a place to study that fits their specific habitual needs? </strong>

						The problem that we are dealing with is that students seem to mainly visit the libraries on campus to find a study spot, but the reality is that there are a plethora of other study spots on and off campus that go unused throughout each passing semester. What seems like a reasonably simple task has turned into a war to see who can place their belongings on a table first—the ultimate form of dibs. If you aren’t the first person waiting at the door of the library to open then you might as well stay in your dorm or apartment and try to get work done there. <strong>Because of this, many students stress—especially when exams and projects start getting assigned—more about getting a table or designated study room than actually studying their course materials.</strong>
					</p><br><br>
					<h3>Ideation</h3>
					<p>During the brainstormming and sketching phase, we were tasked with coming up with 20
						ideation sketches for our app idea, focusing on the key aspects that would differentiate our
						app from similar apps that are on the market. This process helped us evaluate how current
						applications are implementing similar functionalities within their already existing application
						and how those functionalities solve already existing problems.<br><br>
						After sketching the 20 ideas for our application, we had to conduct NUF—or New, Useful,
						and Feasibility—testing to see what our top three ideas were. They are listed as follows;
						implementing augmented reality within our app so users could physically see study spots,
						incorporating a 360 degree camera stream to see how busy places are, and—oddly
					enough—creating portable blinds which block out any distractions.</p><br><br>
					<img class="img-fluid" src="images/NUF-testing.jpg" alt="NUF testing ideas."><caption>New Useful Feasible Test Ideas</caption><br><br><br>
					<h3>Personas</h3>
					<p>
						The next part of the process was figuring out the specific needs of our audience which
						led us to user interviews and persona creation. Our personas embodied two groups of
						people. One was the young undergrad student who could use some time and space
						with their books away from campus, and the second was the young freelancer who is
					always on the move and trying to find a spot to bunker down for an hour or two.</p><br><br> 
					<h3>Prototypes</h3>
					<p>After creating the personas, we set out to design a framework this app could live in. This process was
						not a major innovation of utility apps, but rather a reimagination of who utility apps can
						serve. Still, the user’s needs demanded that our app was not only sleek and up-to-date
						with modern regulations, but also specific and sympathetic to each individual user’s
						desires and situation. <br><br>

						<h2> Wireframes </h2>

<p>Once we came up with our design problem statement, it was time to start designing! We created wireframes of the main user flows which involved creating an account with our application, setting study spot preferences, and finding locations to study at nearby.</p><br><br>

						<h3>Paper Prototype</h3><br><br>

						<img class="img-fluid" src="images/paper-prototype.jpg" alt="Study Spot paper prototype."><caption>Paper Prototype</caption> <br><br>In our design process, we found that the app could be more than
						a simple tool. In our feedback, we realised that more than only giving people a place to
						go, this could also be a way for people to connect with their friends when they go out
						to study. <br><br>Another change that came with the design was the title. At first, “Your Spot
						Finder” was our title for the app. After more feedback and prototyping, we came up with
						“Study Spot” as a slim-fitting title for this new app that will make finding an accomodating
						study location easy and simple to find.<br><br></p>

						<h2>The Solution</h2>
						<p>Study Spot is our solution. Find places to study quickly and efficiently without having to worry about where you can get your work accomplished. This is the most innovative application that allows for students to find specific places to study.</p>
