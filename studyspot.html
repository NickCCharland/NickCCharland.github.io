					<h2>About This Project</h2>
					<p>
						This project was completed in SMAD 317: User Interaction Design. The purpose for creating this project was to explore the fundamentals of User Interaction Design through utilizing the design thinking process. This included empathizing, defining, idealizing, protoyping, and testing an idea for an application that solved a specific issue.<br><br>
						This project came out of an idea for
						students, professionals, and anyone else who does their work outside of an office to
						find an easy place to study or do their work. Originally, we geared this project towards
						college students, but it has become a tool for a much greater audience.<br><br></p>
						<h2>Overview</h2>
						<p>We began
							with brainstorming the idea alongside looking at other apps who served a similar purpose.
							We found the other apps that served a similar function either had low functionality
							or aimed to serve a hyperspecific audience, so we set out to conquer both of these hills.<br><br>
							The next part of the process was figuring out the specific needs of our audience which
							led us to user interviews and persona creation. Our personas embodied two groups of
							people. One was the young undergrad student who could use some time and space
							with their books away from campus, and the second was the young freelancer who is
							always on the move and trying to find a spot to bunker down for an hour or two.<br><br> After
							the personas, we set out to design a framework this app could live in. This process was
							not a major innovation of utility apps, but rather a reimagination of who utility apps can
							serve. Still, the user’s needs demanded that our app was not only sleek and up-to-date
							with modern regulations, but also specific and sympathetic to each individual user’s
							desires and situation. In our design process, we found that the app could be more than
							a simple tool. In our feedback, we realised that more than only giving people a place to
							go, this could also be a way for people to connect with their friends when they go out
							to study. <br><br>Another change that came with the design was the title. At first, “Your Spot
							Finder” was our title for the app. After more feedback and prototyping, we came up with
							“Study Spot” as a slim-fitting title for this new app that will make finding an accomodating
							study location easy and simple to find.<br><br></p>
							<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
							<p>The problem that we are dealing with is that students seem to mainly visit the libraries on campus to find a study spot, but the reality is that there are a plethora of other study spots on and off campus that go unused throughout each passing semester. What seems like a reasonably simple task has turned into a war to see who can place their belongings on a table first—the ultimate form of dibs. If you aren’t the first person waiting at the door of the library to open then you might as well stay in your dorm or apartment and try to get work done there. <strong>Because of this, many students stress—especially when exams and projects start getting assigned—more about getting a table or designated study room than actually studying their course materials.</strong>
							</p><br><br>
							<h2>The Solution</h2>
							<p>Study Spot is our solution. Find places to study quickly and efficiently without having to worry about where you can get your work accomplished. This is the most innovative application that allows for students to find specific places to study.</p>
