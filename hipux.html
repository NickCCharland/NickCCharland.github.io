					<br><p>This is a collection of websites that I created over the course of a semester to showcase my written communication and design skills. The goal of this project was to utilize WordPress.org in combination with Divi Themes to create intriguing webistes while learning about Content Management Systems.</p>

					<h2>Vegetarian Recipes Website</h2><br>
					<p>This website was created in hopes of providing users with tasty—and cost effective—vegetarian recipes. My goal for this website was to showcase my love for cooking, writing about food, photography, and website design in a collective and cohesive manner. I was provided with access to WordPress.org and a robust themes package that provided me with a great starting point for this webpage. However, through utilizing custom HTML and CSS language, I was able to make a site that was truly my own.</p><br>
					<p>The main navigation consists of pages for recipes, which are broken down by meal types. I also wanted to provide users with access to other resources to find other delicious recipes that they would want to make.</p><br>
					<img class="img-fluid" src="images/veggie-home.png" alt="mockups of vegetarian recipes website."><br><br>
					<p>I chose a color theme and supporting typography that reflected a restaurant menu to make the user feel as though they are experiencing fancy DIY dining. I also created the logo with that goal in mind, but to also reflect the fact that the recipes I provided were healthier options to what some may consider traditional recipes. I photographed and documented the process of making the dishes and properly sized them in Photoshop so that I could decrease data bandwidth usage for users.</p><br><img class="img-fluid" src="images/veggie-design.png" alt="mockups of vegetarian recipes website."><br><br>
					<p>Overall, I am thrilled with how this website turned out as it was my first time working with Content Management Systems. This was a great opportunity for me to showcase many different skills into one collective piece of work which was new for me, but I enjoyed playing many different roles throughout this project.</p><br><br>

					<h2>The Modern Camper Website</h2><br>
					<p>The Modern Camper was another project that I completed for the same course. Much like the Vegetarian Recipes website, The Modern Camper was created out of a passion for hiking and camping, as well as furthering my skills in Adobe Illustrator. One of the main goals for this project was to provide camping resources to users who enjoy camping in Virginia.</p><br>
					<p>The main navigation for this website includes personal stories of mine which reveal why camping has such a special place in my heart, the history of camping, resources to find cheap or free campsites, and a mockup online store where users can “purchase” branded merchandise.</p><br>
					<img class="img-fluid" src="images/modcamp.png" alt="mockups of the modern camper website."><br><br>
					<p>One design choice that I made for this website was to convey a sense of the outdoors through high-quality illustrations and varying color schemes to represent the ever-changing outdoor scenery of Virginia. In order to achieve this, I explored different functionalities in Adobe Illustrator to create scenes that were familiar to me.</p><br>
					<img class="img-fluid" src="images/camp-2.png" alt="mockups of the modern camper website."><br><br>
					<p>As far as content goes, I wanted to provide users with some background about me and why I love camping and hiking. This is valuable to users because it makes the website seem more personable and relatable. I really enjoyed creating this website because it is something that pushed me out of my comfort zone as far as illustration goes. I am excited to showcase this as a part of my portfolio.</p><br>
