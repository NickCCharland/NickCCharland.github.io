			<p>In a world where online learning is the new normal and students are trying their hardest to stay afloat while staying at home, there are many applications that are being used to help students keep track of their assignments and Zoom meetings. The first application that comes to mind is Canvas Student, or just Canvas to many.<br><br>
				Optimizing efficiency within the Canvas app, however, can be quite the challenge due to the lack of some features that could improve navigation. More specifically, customization options that lack in the Groups section of canvas.<br><br>
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="content-2">
			<h2>Users and Their Goals</h2>
			<p>Many college students&#8212;and even high schoolers&#8212;utilize Canvas to manage their school work. This tool comes in handy when trying to find out what announcements professors have made, or knowing grades received on previous assignments.<br><br>
			Thus, the primary users of this app are college students who are enrolled in a full time or part time schedule. After conducting a Google Forms survey which included 28 responses, the user goals have been identified as the following&#59;</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Checking announcements from professors</li>
				<li>Customizing courses for optimum navigation</li>
				<li>Checking grades when they are posted</li>
				<li>Reading posts in course groups</li>
			</ul>
			<br><br>
		</div>

		<div class="content-3">
			<h2>App Analysis</h2>
			<p>After having identified the goals of Canvas users, I felt that it was necessary to identify how Canvas currently accomplishes and lacks in the identified areas.<br><br>
				At first glance, Canvas is a really sleek and easy to use file management application. There is great visual hierarchy throughout the interface, and it isn’t overbearing with its simple, modular layout unlike some of its competitors. Being a Canvas user myself, I can appreciate the interface that they have developed.<br><br>
			Upon further examination, however, I found that while Canvas is good at notifying students about announcements and checking grades, it truly lacks at allowing students to fully customize their dashboard. And while this doesn’t seem to be an issue in the courses section, it is within the groups section of the dashboard.</p>

			<p>The current customization options for courses within the Canvas app allows for users to set a color overlay for each course, as well as set a nickname for each course which is unique to each user. Based on the feedback that I received from the user research, students would like to be able to do this for their course groups, yet there is no option for this within Canvas.

				<h2>Design Problem Statement</h2>
				<p>After reflecting on the data that I gathered about customization options within Canvas, I concluded that one of the main pain points that users have is not being able to customize the entirety of their Canvas Dashboard. Adding customization features to the groups section of Canvas would allow for users to declutter their dashboards and help identify groups more easily upon opening the app. There is one vital question, though.<br><br>
					How might we refine the experience of students trying to customize their groups on the Canvas app?
				</p>

				<h2>Finding the Solution</h2>
				<br>
				<h3>User Flow Map</h3>
				<p>In order to streamline the navigation flow and minimize dashboard clutter, I decided to focus on users having the ability to change the color of a course group and delete a group from their dashboard. This way, users could have the option to remove old groups from previous courses, as well as organize and revitalize their current course groups.<br><br>
					In order to understand what that could look like, I mapped out a user flow chart to see how this could be achieved.<br></p>

					<br><br>
					<h3>Wireframes<br></h3>
					<p>Next comes the wireframes. I wanted to maintain the sleek user interface design of Canvas, so i decided to add a drop down menu to each group within this section. From there, users would be shown a menu which contains the options to rename a group, change a group color, manage the notifications for each group, and to remove a group from the dashboard. I didn’t want to overcrowd the menu because that could probably make the experience less enjoyable—or frustrating—for the user. This is what I initially came up with.<br></p>

					<br><br>
					<h3>High&#x2010;fidelity Mockups<br></h3>
					<p>From here, I created high-fidelity mockups that would mimic the current groups section but also implement the new design idea. This design implements a user-friendly way to customize the groups section in a matter of seconds while focusing on the user needs of streamlined navigation and optimization of space on the dashboard.<br></p>

					<h2>Conclusion</h2>
					<p>If I were to continue with redesigning this aspect of Canvas, I would love to see how users would react to the changes and ask what suggestions they had in order to get the most out of this function. Hopefully this solution addresses the needs of the users and offers up a streamlined way of staying on task and optimizing secondary navigation within the Canvas app.
